"""Everything `framework/` imports must be something we actually depend on.

`framework/cli_style.py` shipped with `import click` and passed locally, because a
`[all]` install had pulled click in as some other package's transitive dependency.
It is not one of ours: typer >= 0.26 vendors click as `typer._click` and does not
require the standalone distribution, so CI — which installs exactly what pyproject
declares — died on ModuleNotFoundError at the entry point. A green local suite is
not evidence here, and nothing else in the tree checks it.

So: resolve every third-party module the framework imports to its distribution, and
require that distribution to be inside the dependency closure of what pyproject
declares. Transitively-guaranteed packages (rich, which typer requires) pass because
they are genuinely in the closure; incidentally-present ones (click) do not.

Static over the source tree, like tests/test_category_requires.py: importing the
modules to see what resolves would pass vacuously in the very environment this
exists to police.
