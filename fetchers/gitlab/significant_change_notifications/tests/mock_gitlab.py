# Change Request
- [ ] Emergency Change (add Justification to Summary below)

### Scope
- [ ] Application Release (Helm), ticket: [ABC-??](https://example.atlassian.net/browse/ABC-??)
- [ ] Deployed Software (Helm)
- [X] Infrastructure (Terraform)
- [ ] Other (manual changes)

### Impact
- [ ] C1: High Impact/Risk, may cause Production downtime
- [ ] C2: Med Impact/Risk, may cause Production slowness, or Staging downtime
- [X] C3: Low Impact/Risk, may require complex manual changes
- [ ] C4: No Impact/Risk, common changes or fully automated

## Requested Changes
Replacing the incumbent third-party vulnerability scanner with a cloud security posture management platform across the authorization boundary. The replacement covers container runtime, cloud posture and source-code scanning in one tool.

### Impact and Security Analysis
Broader vulnerability coverage and more automated triage. Introduces a new third-party vendor with read access to cloud configuration metadata. Data-scanning features that would reach customer data are deliberately left disabled, so the vendor sees configuration state only.

## FedRAMP Significant Change Notification (SCN)
- [ ] [Routine Recurring](https://www.fedramp.gov/2026/providers/20x/rules/significant-change-notification/#routine-recurring-changes)  — SCN not required
- [X] Significant Change — SCN required (expand section below)

** SCN Details** — expand if Significant Change is checked above
Fields marked **\\[REQUIRED\\]** map to required FedRAMP schema properties.

**Change Type** *(`changeType`)* **\\[REQUIRED\\]**
- [X] Adaptive
- [ ] Transformative

[Adaptive](https://www.fedramp.gov/2026/providers/20x/rules/significant-change-notification/#adaptive-changes) changes typically require careful planning that focuses on engineering execution instead of customer adoption, can be verified with minor changes to existing automated validation procedures, and do not require large changes to operational procedures, deployment plans, or documentation.

Transformative changes typically introduce major features or capabilities that may change how a customer uses the service (in whole or in part) and require extensive updates to security assessments, operational procedures, deployment plans, and documentation.

**Categorization Explanation** *(`changeTypeExplanation`)*
This is a like-for-like component replacement. FedRAMP gives exactly this as an example of an adaptive change: replacing a component where some security plan or procedure adjustments are required, such as a scanning tool or managed database swap.

**Reason for Change** *(`reason`)*
Broader coverage across container runtime, cloud posture and source code, plus the automation needed to support risk-based vulnerability triage.

**Related Vulnerability** *(`relatedVulnerability`)*
N/A

**Assessor Name** *(`assessorName`)*
N/A

**Impact Analysis**
**Customer Impact** *(`customerImpact`)*
No customer impact anticipated. The scanner is a backend security tool and is not exposed to customers. No change to customer configuration responsibilities.

**Impacted Controls** **Impacted KSIs or Rev5 Controls** *(`impactedControls[]`)* (List KSI or control identifiers that will be verified, assessed, or validated as part of this change. One per line.)

**Plan and Timeline** **Summary** *(`planAndTimeline.summary`)* **\\[REQUIRED within planAndTimeline\\]** (Plan and timeline summary, including verification/assessment/validation approach for impacted KSIs or controls)

**Planned Start** *(`planAndTimeline.plannedStart`)*
Date: `YYYY-MM-DD`

**Planned Completion** *(`planAndTimeline.plannedCompletion`)*

**Milestones** *(`planAndTimeline.milestones[]`)*
