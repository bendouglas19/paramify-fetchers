"""Resolving the Paramify API token and base URL, in one place.

Both were resolved independently in four places (each uploader, and each of
api.py's two preflights) and they did not agree, which is the whole reason this
module exists — see `resolve_upload_token`.

Nothing here reads a file or makes a request: callers populate the environment by
whatever mechanism they use (.env, shell export, secret manager, CI secret block,
K8s secret mount), and this only reads it back. Both functions report WHERE a
value came from, not just what it is, because "which URL am I about to upload to"
and "which of the two token vars is in play" are the two questions people
actually get wrong.
